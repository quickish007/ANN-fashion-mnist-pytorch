- In this project, I used the Fashion MNIST dataset, which can be found on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zalando-research/fashionmnist
- The dataset contains a total of 60,000 images of T-shirts, pants, bags, and shoes. However, I used only 6,000 images since I planned to run the ANN model on a CPU.
- When training the model on a CPU, we achieved approximately 82%â€“83% accuracy.
  
Note: If you want to train the model with all 60,000 images, a GPU is recommended.
