- In this project I have used Fashion mnist dataset which you can get it from Kaggle --> https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zalando-research/fashionmnist
- This dataset contains total 60,000 Images of T-shirts, Pants, Bags and shoes, out of which I have used only 6000 Images to because I was planning to run this ANN model on CPU.
- While running this ANN model on CPU we got approx, 82%-83% accuracy.
  
Note: If you want to train model with 60,000 Images you need GPU.
